# Once you find_package(ROBOTICSLAB_KINEMATICS_DYNAMICS), it defines:
#
# * several targets; it's advised to link against individual libraries with the usual
#   target_link_libraries() command - if you do this, you won't need to manually include
#   the directories that these libraries require nor other compiler options
#
# * ROBOTICSLAB_KINEMATICS_DYNAMICS_INCLUDE_DIRS; obligatory if you want to include
#   interface headers, use include_directories(${ROBOTICSLAB_KINEMATICS_DYNAMICS_INCLUDE_DIRS})
#
# * ROBOTICSLAB_KINEMATICS_DYNAMICS_LIBRARIES; shorthand for linking against all targets at once,
#   use target_link_libraries(${KEYWORD} ${ROBOTICSLAB_KINEMATICS_DYNAMICS_LIBRARIES})
